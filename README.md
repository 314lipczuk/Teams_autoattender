### Teams_autoattender

## DISCLAIMER:

STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT, A LOT OF STUPID HACKS INSIDE.
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO YOUR PSYCHE CAUSED BY READING THIS CODE.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
WHINERS WILL BE IGNORED.

no, but seriously, if someone actually sees this and knows how to make it better, i'll be glad to learn something new.

Main idea is if you ever feel like you're gonna sleep through your first meeting of the day, you leave this bad boy running, and let him join whatever room at whatever hour you set up.
Timetable and room setup can be found i a table json file. I'll make a script to generate it later. Credentials to your teams you put in .pb file login:password.
Things i know need to be done:
  *Script for autogenerating tables and .pb
  *Deal with crashes on lecture end
  *Make a non-hardcoded timer for lecture lenght
  *Rework how time works
